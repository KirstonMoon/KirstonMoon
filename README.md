## 👋 About Me

I'm an iOS developer with 7+ years of commercial experience working in diverse teams (up to 20 members), both remotely and on-site.

I specialize in building the full development cycle — from gathering product requirements to releasing stable, test-covered, analytics-rich apps using CI/CD pipelines. I'm particularly strong in **functional reactive programming** and **declarative UI**.

- 💻 Languages: **Swift**, **Objective-C**
- 🎯 Focus on: **Clean architecture**, **Performance optimization**, **Test-driven development**
- ⚙️ Experience with: RESTful APIs, Core Data, Realm, SQLite
- 🧪 Testing: Unit tests, UI tests using **XCTest**, **XCUITest**, **TDD**
- 🧠 Methodologies: **Scrum**, **Kanban**, code reviews, pair programming
